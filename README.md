# Motivation for Thorsten-Voice project :speaking_head: :speech_balloon:
A **free** to use, **offline** working, **high quality** **german** **TTS** voice should be available for every project without any license struggling.

# Personal words by Thorsten MÃ¼ller
> I contribute my voice as a person believing in a world where all people are equal. No matter of gender, sexual orientation, religion, skin color and geocoordinates of birth location. A global world where everybody is warmly welcome on any place on this planet and open and free knowledge and education is available to everyone. :earth_africa: (*Thorsten MÃ¼ller*)

Please keep in mind, that **i am no professional voice talent**. I'm just a normal guy sharing his voice with the world.

### Dataset summary
* Recorded by Thorsten MÃ¼ller
* Optimized by Dominik Kreutz
* LJSpeech file and directory structure
* 22.668 recorded phrases (*wav files*)
* More than 23 hours of pure audio
* Samplerate 22.050Hz
* Mono
* Normalized to -24dB
* Phrase length (min/avg/max): 2 / 52 / 180 chars
* No silence at beginning/ending

### Dataset evolution
As described in the PDF document ([evolution of thorsten dataset](./EvolutionOfThorstenDataset.pdf)) this dataset consists of three recording phases.

* **Phase 1**: Recorded with a cheap usb microphone (*low quality*)
* **Phase 2**: Recorded with a good microphone (*good quality*)
* **Phase 3**: Recorded with same good microphone but longer phrases (> 100 chars) (*good quality*)

If you want to use a dataset subset you can see which files belong to which recording phase in [recording quality](./RecordingQuality.csv) csv file.

All emotional recordings where recorded by myself and i tried to feel and pronounce that emotion even if the phrase context does not match that emotion. Example: I pronounced the sleepy recordings in the tone i have shortly before falling asleep.

# TTS Models
Based on these opensource voice datasets several TTS (text to speech) models have been trained using AI / machine learning technology.

There are multiple german models available trained and used by by the projects [**Coqui AI**](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS/), [**Piper TTS**](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) and [**Home Assistant**](https://www.home-assistant.io/). You can find more information on how to use them, audio samples and video tutorials on the [Thorsten-Voice project website](https://www.Thorsten-Voice.de).

Listen to audio samples and installation / usage instructions here (ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª):
* [Neutral TTS](https://www.thorsten-voice.de/kostenloses-deutsches-text-to-speech-tts/)
* [Emotional TTS](https://www.thorsten-voice.de/emotionales-tts/)
* [Hessisches TTS](https://www.thorsten-voice.de/guude/)
* [Smarthome / Home Assistant](https://www.thorsten-voice.de/home-assistant-thorsten-voice/)

In addition Silero, Monatis and ZDisket used my voice datasets for model training too. More samples and details can be found on [Silero Thorsten-Voice audio samples](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tR6w4kgRS2JJ1TWZhwoFuU04Xkgo6YAs?usp=sharing). See this [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/snakers4/silero-models/blob/master/examples_tts.ipynb) for more details.

[ZDisket](https://github.com/ZDisket/TensorVox) made a tool called TensorVox for setting up an TTS environment on Windows and included a german TTS model trained by [monatis](https://github.com/monatis/german-tts). Thanks for sharing that. See it in action on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/tY6_xZnkv-A).

# Public talks
I really like to talk about the importance of an opensource voice technology future. If you would like me to be a speaker on a conference or event i'd happy to be contacted using the Thorsten-Voice [website contact form](https://www.thorsten-voice.de/en/contact/). See some of my speaker references on [Thorsten-Voice website](https://www.thorsten-voice.de/en/speaker-public-talks/).

# "Thorsten-Voice" Youtube channel
In summer 2021 i've started to share my lessons learned and experiences on open voice tech, in special **TTS** on my little [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThorstenMueller). If you check out and like my videos i'd happy to welcome you as subscriber and member of my little Youtube community.
