# Motivation for Thorsten-Voice project :speaking_head: :speech_balloon:
A **free** to use, **offline** working, **high quality** **german** **TTS** voice should be available for every project without any license struggling.

# Personal words by Thorsten MÃ¼ller
> I contribute my voice as a person believing in a world where all people are equal. No matter of gender, sexual orientation, religion, skin color and geocoordinates of birth location. A global world where everybody is warmly welcome on any place on this planet and open and free knowledge and education is available to everyone. :earth_africa: (*Thorsten MÃ¼ller*)

Please keep in mind, that **i am no professional voice talent**. I'm just a normal guy sharing his voice with the world.

### Dataset evolution
As described in the PDF document ([evolution of thorsten dataset](./EvolutionOfThorstenDataset.pdf)) this dataset consists of three recording phases.

* **Phase 1**: Recorded with a cheap usb microphone (*low quality*)
* **Phase 2**: Recorded with a good microphone (*good quality*)
* **Phase 3**: Recorded with same good microphone but longer phrases (> 100 chars) (*good quality*)

If you want to use a dataset subset you can see which files belong to which recording phase in [recording quality](./RecordingQuality.csv) csv file.

[ZDisket](https://github.com/ZDisket/TensorVox) made a tool called TensorVox for setting up an TTS environment on Windows and included a german TTS model trained by [monatis](https://github.com/monatis/german-tts). Thanks for sharing that :thumbsup:. See it in action on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/tY6_xZnkv-A).

# Public talks
I really want to bring the topic "**Open Voice For An Open Future**" to a bigger public attention.

* I was invited by [Yusuf](https://github.com/monatis/) from Turkish tensorflow community to talk on "How to make machines speak with your own voice". This talk has been streamed live on Youtube and is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-Uwb-Bg144&t=2303s). If you're interested on the showed slides, feel free to download my presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ynnw0ilKV3WwMSJHytrN3GXRiFr8x3r0DUimBm1y0LI/edit?usp=sharing) (*June 2021*)
)
* I've been invited as speaker on VoiceLunch language & linguistics on 03.01.2022. [Here are my slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gi6BmYHs7g4ZgdAiIKGBnBwZDCvJOD9DJxQOGlgds1o/edit?usp=sharing) (*January 2022*).

# Youtube channel

## Even more special people
Additionally, a really nice thanks for my dear colleague, Sebastian Kraus, for supporting me with audio recording equipment and for being the creative mastermind behind the logo design.

And last but not least i want to say a **huge, huge thank you** to a special guy who supported me on this journey as a partner right from the beginning. Not just with nice words, but with his time, audio optimization knowhow and finally GPU power. 

**Thank you so much, dear **Dominik** ([@domcross](https://github.com/domcross/)) for being my partner on this journey.**
